  <h1>Glass Analysis App</h1>
  <p>This app calculates glass weight, stress, and deflection for rectangular glass units using classic plate theory for 4 sided and 2 sided simply supports and using beam equation for cantilevered support.
  </p>
  <p>This app is intended for preliminary estimation of glass stress and deflection and NOT intended for critical design nor analysis.
